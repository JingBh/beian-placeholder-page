# Placeholder Page

Sometimes one needs a placeholder page, but default placeholder pages like the ones used by web hosts tend to be less than pretty and they might even be full of other people's logos and links. This is a clean, pretty alternative.

I'll probably do something more interesting with this at some point—add a build script or maybe even make a generator web site—but for now there's HTML, CSS, a PNG image file, and a shortcut image file for you to customize or replace as you like.

## About the Background Photos

The background photos are loaded from [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/ "Unsplash Source | A Simple API for Embedding Free Photos from Unsplash"), which selects them at random from their mountain and lake pictures. Look for this line in **placeholder.css** if you want to change that:

```css
background: #ccc url(https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?mountain,lake) center center/cover fixed;
```

## Options

The HTML and CSS include both featured-image and initial-text options, so you can easily add a logo or a picture of your smiling mug if you prefer.

There are also some combo buttons to use or remove as you prefer. If you do remove them and you haven't added anything else that uses Bootstrap, you can go ahead and remove the BootstrapCDN stylesheet link too.
