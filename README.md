# Placeholder Page

Sometimes one needs a placeholder page, but default placeholder pages like the ones used by web hosts tend to be less than pretty and they might even be full of other people's logos and links. This is a clean, pretty alternative.

I'll probably do something more interesting with this at some point—add a build script or maybe even make a generator web site—but for now there's HTML, CSS, a PNG image file, and a shortcut image file for you to customize or replace as you like.

## Live Demo

You can see a live demo running [here](https://bdsexton.github.io/placeholder-page/ "Placeholder Page").

### Running the Live Demo Locally

GitHub Pages serves the above linked page from the "docs" folder, which contains a minified version of the placeholder page with a "Fork me on GitHub" banner. If you would like to run that already-built version locally, either open index.html in your browser directly or, if you have both npm and Browsersync installed, enter the following at your command line:

```shell
npm run demo
```

## About the Background Photos

The background photos are loaded from [Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com/ "Unsplash Source | A Simple API for Embedding Free Photos from Unsplash"), which selects them at random from their featured mountain and lake pictures. Look for this line in **placeholder.css** if you want to change that:

```css
background: #ccc url(https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?mountain,lake) center center/cover fixed;
```

## Options

The HTML and CSS include both featured-image and initial-text options, so you can easily add a logo or a picture of your smiling mug if you prefer.

There are also some combo buttons to use or remove as you prefer. If you do remove them and you haven't added anything else that uses Bootstrap, you can go ahead and remove the BootstrapCDN stylesheet link too.

## To Build or Not to Build…

**Building the placeholder page yourself is optional.**

### Using the Placeholder Page Without Building

If you would like to use the placeholder page with the HTML and CSS as they are in the "source" folder, you can do so easily. Just change "placeholder.min.css" to "placeholder.css" in one of the stylesheet links at the top of index.html.

**Optional:** You may want to manually add the contents of _file-header.css or something similar to the top of placeholder.css.

### Building the Placeholder Page

Even though this is a simple project, there is a build script to assemble and minify the CSS, minify the HTML, and make copies of everything in a new folder. There are a few reasons I've set things up this way, including:

* Minified files take less bandwidth. How much less depends upon the sizes of the source files, but this project loads large images, so I'll take every little bit of bandwidth savings I can get.
* Separating the CSS into two files then recombining them means one can be minified and the other left alone, allowing important CSS comments to stay intact through minification.
* I would like to experiment with some tool-assisted customizations.

First you'll need to make sure you have the project's dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

After that, building is easy.

```shell
grunt build
```

If you would like to work in the source folder and have your changes automatically built and displayed in your browser via Browsersync, just use the default Grunt task.

```shell
grunt
```

*Warning: The default Grunt task starts by deleting the "build" folder.*

## Local Testing

I like to use [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/ "Browsersync - Time-saving synchronised browser testing") for local testing. You can use it with a task runner such as [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/ "Grunt: The JavaScript Task Runner") or directly like so:

```shell
browser-sync start --server build
```

That "build" value after the --server argument tells Browsersync we want it to serve files from the "build" directory, which is created when building the project via the Gruntfile.

If you want Browsersync to start with a page other than index.html just tell it what page to use with an --index argument like so:

```shell
browser-sync start --server build --index hello.html
```

If you would like to learn more about Browsersync's command line options, see [Browsersync Command Line Usage](https://browsersync.io/docs/command-line "Browsersync Command Line Usage").

## Room for Improvement

I have a few thoughts:

* There could probably be some further mobile optimization, especially with regard to background image sizes.
* The build script could modify the stylesheet link so the version in the "source" folder could remain functional.
* It might be nice to have an easy way to select whether to use a featured image or initial text as part of the build process rather than editing the HTML directly. That might be overkill, though.
* I really like the idea of making a browser-based tool to make placeholder pages.
* Perhaps I should offer a download of just the essential files for people who are not inclined to use repositories, build scripts, and magic spells.
